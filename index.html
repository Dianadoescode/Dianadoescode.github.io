			<h2> About my family: </h2>
			<p> I come from a small family, but its okay because we all get to tell eachother everything. I live with my mom and my step dad. I like to go and visit my dad when I can. I have 3 siblings. 2 sisters and 1 brother and they are all in their twentys. My eldest sister has kids so I was a auntie at 3 years old. My siblings come to visit me every once in a while to make sure im doing good in school. </p>
