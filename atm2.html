		<h2> Reflection </h2>
		<p> Overall the program is the best one yet. This program gives you a headstart on the computer. It teaches you about the computer and the programs on the computer. This program teaches you how to type and improve your typing skills. The best part is that the teacher will help or support you no matter what.</p>
